title: Terminal Image and Video Viewer
summary: An image viewer for terminal emulators.
description: |
  A user-friendly viewer that uses 24-Bit color capabilities
  and unicode character blocks to display images, animations
  and videos in the terminal.

  On terminals that implement the Kitty Graphics Protocol or
  the iTerm2 Graphics Protocol this displays images in full resolution.

  Displays regular images, plays animated gifs, scrolls static images
  and plays videos.

# Only PNG or SVG image is supported, dimension must be greater than 256x256px

# Version string just for humans, typically '1.2+git' or '1.3.2'
# The wrapping single quotes are often required to avoid the version string
# being accidentally interpreted as a YAML non-string(like '1', '1.2').
